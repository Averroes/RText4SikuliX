RText4SikuliX
=============

RText implementation for use with SikuliX 

(based on [the works here](https://github.com/bobbylight) from Robert Futrell at http://fifesoft.com/)

This is the result of the first step:
- converting the Eclipse/ANT based packages into a multimodule Maven project
- currently the RText4Sikuli package compiles on Mac OSX 10.9 with Java 7
- the the editor starts up and seems to work with the basic features
 
**The goal is to integrate the Sikuli specifics: Image management and script run**

This is really the very first step of work in progress.<br/>
Especially not all license related aspects are in place.<br/>
Changes/additions to the sources have not yet been made.<br/>
