RText4SikuliX
=============

RText implementation for use with SikuliX 

(based on [the works here](https://github.com/bobbylight) from Robert Futrell at http://fifesoft.com/)

This is the result of the first step:
- converting the Eclipse/ANT based packages into a multimodule Maven project
- currently the RText4Sikuli package compiles on Mac OSX 10.9 with Java 7
- the the editor (package RText) starts up and seems to work with the basic features
- this project is developed in Netbeans 7.4
 
**The goal is to integrate the Sikuli specifics:** 
- Image management
- script run
- global options
- autocomplete 

and things that might be missing at first glance:
- autoindentation
- collapse line blocks

This is really the very first step of work in progress.<br/>
Especially not all license related aspects are in place.<br/>
Changes/additions to the sources have not yet been made.<br/>
